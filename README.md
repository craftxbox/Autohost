# Autohost for TETR.IO

A bot for osk's TETR.IO that allows for the following additional features in custom games:

* Automatic game starts
* Participation requirements:
    * Minimum / maximum rank
    * Minimum level
* Room bans
* Custom game presets

This is built on a custom Ribbon implementation in Node.js.

Currently it's full of bugs. I know. I'll fix them at some point.

## ⚠⚠⚠ BIG SCARY DISCLAIMER ⚠⚠⚠

The source code is here to allow you to contribute to development and (perhaps) to learn. It's **NOT** for making
unauthorised bots. Ask osk for permission before connecting to tetr.io with anything other than the official client.

**You will be banned if you don't follow the rules. It's not my fault if that happens.**
